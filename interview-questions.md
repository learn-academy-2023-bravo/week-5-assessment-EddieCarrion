# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What does calling super do in a Ruby class?

Your answer: Calling the super method allows information to be transferred to classes and sub classes

Researched answer: Calling the super method will send a specific message that allows a subclass to borrow specific data from the superclass. For example you can have a superclass called "Animal" with specific information and then extract that information in a subclass called "Four legged".

2. What is a gem?

Your answer:A gem is a nest that holds snippets of code.

Researched answer: A gem is a library that contains snippets of coding data. Ruby manages these snippets of code in a manger called RubyGems. This makes it much easier for a web developer to share code with other web developers.

3. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: A relational database is a database that contains information in rows and columns. I am not quite sure if there are other types of databases but I would assume they exist and are not meant to be shared.

Researched answer: A relational database is a database that can be shared with others and resembles a spreadsheet because it contains columns and rows. They are also no relational databases often called "NoSQL" databases. They differ from relational databases in that they contain information differently (not in a table). A document would be an example of what a non-relational datatype structure would look like. A document contains alot of information that contains specific details, making it more flexible than a relational database. 

4. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer: Primary keys is a specific identifier for a specific class instance. Primary keys are important because we can use them to access specific information as needed.

Researched answer: Primary keys contain unique unique values and can identify each row in a table. They are important because a database needs them to update,delete, and insert information to the table. They also prevent issues since they contain unique id's for each instance.

5. What are the HTTP verbs? What is each verb's corresponding CRUD action?

Your answer:I do not remember off of the top of my head. 

Researched answer:The HTTP verbs are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. They relate to the acronym CRUD because they essentially create, read, update, and delete. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Model validations: Model validations ensure that only the valid information is stored in the database. Rails rus all model validations before information is added and will not save if the validations experiences any errors.

2. RESTful routes:Routes are how specific requests are directed to code that handles the routes. RESTful routes is a more structured way of defining how a route will work. The yprovide mapping between HTTP verbs.

3. ERB:ERB stand for Embedded Ruby, it is a file that allows the web developer to combine HTML and Ruby code.

4. Params:Parms allow us to add information by passing a value. Adding Params allows the developer to add information by passing the value into the route rather than the URL.

5. API:API (Application Programming Interface) which is a set of protocols for building application software.
